### Ideas (checked = confirmed)

- Queries and mutations
  - [ ] Decide if we need to have seperate apis for query and mutation (for semantic reasons).
  - [ ] Query composition
  - [ ] Implicit variables

- Authentication
  - [x] Allow extending headers

- Fragments
  - [x] Simple fragments
  - [ ] Parameterized fragments

- Caching
  - [x] Local storage
  - [x] Memory
  - [ ] IDB

- Bindings
  - [x] React
  - [x] Vue
  - [ ] jQuery (obviously)

- [ ] Babel plugin to precompute some of the query stuff (Big maybe?)
