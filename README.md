### Ideas

- [ ] Queries and mutations
  - [ ] Decide if we need to have seperate apis for query and mutation (for semantic reasons).
  - [ ] Query composition
  - [ ] Implicit variables (Maybe?)

- [ ] Authentication
  - [ ] Allow extending headers

- [ ] Fragments
  - [ ] Simple fragments
  - [ ] Parameterized fragments (Maybe?)

- [ ] Caching
  - [ ] Local storage
  - [ ] Memory
  - [ ] IDB (Maybe?)

- [ ] Bindings
  - [ ] React
  - [ ] Vue
  - [ ] jQuery (obviously)

- [ ] Babel plugin to precompute some of the query stuff (Big maybe?)
